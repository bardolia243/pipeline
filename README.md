Introduction
Jenkins is a widely used automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating any project. This project sets up a Jenkins pipeline using Docker to containerize the entire build and deployment process.

Requirements
To run this Jenkins pipeline, you'll need:

Docker installed on your machine.
Internet connectivity for Jenkins to download necessary plugins.
Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jenkins-pipeline-docker.git
Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd jenkins-pipeline-docker
Build the Docker image for Jenkins:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t jenkins-pipeline .
Run the Jenkins Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins-master jenkins-pipeline
Access Jenkins in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

Retrieve the Jenkins unlock key from the container logs:

bash
Copy code
docker logs jenkins-master
Copy the unlock key and proceed with the Jenkins setup.

Install necessary plugins and create an admin user.

Create a new pipeline project and configure it to use the pipeline script from the Jenkinsfile in this repository.

Pipeline Configuration
The Jenkins pipeline is configured using a Jenkinsfile. Adjust the stages, steps, and configurations in the Jenkinsfile based on your specific build and deployment requirements.

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Add build steps here
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Add test steps here
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Add deployment steps here
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Add post-build actions here
        }
    }
}
Docker Configuration
The Docker configuration for Jenkins is defined in the Dockerfile. Customize the Dockerfile based on your specific Jenkins and plugin requirements.

Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts

USER root

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y docker.io

USER jenkins

COPY plugins.txt /usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins.txt
RUN /usr/local/bin/install-plugins.sh < /usr/share/jenkins/ref/plugins.txt
